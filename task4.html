        <h1>A HISTORICAL PLACE (TAJ MAHAL) </h1>
          <!-- Paragraph about TAJ Mahal -->
        <p>A visit to a <strong>historical placeis </strong>very educative. It instructs as well as entertains us. I am fond of visiting historical buildings. Last year, I went to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. In the evening, we went to see the Taj Mahal. I had heard a lot about the beauty of the Taj Mahal. But reality surpassed the descriptions that had been given to me.

            It is a wonder in marble, a specimen of Mughal art <span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/eight-secrets-taj-mahal-180962168/" target="_blank">Taj Mahal</a></span> was built by Shah Jahan in the sweet memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It was built about three hundred and fifty years ago.  It stands on the right bank of the river Yamuna. The gateway which is made of red stone is very beautiful. The garden is very lovely. The tall dark cypress trees, smooth green lawns, and the beds of flowers are pleasing to the eyes. The fountains flow here and there.
